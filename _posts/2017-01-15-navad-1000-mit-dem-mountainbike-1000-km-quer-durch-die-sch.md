Everyone else might alternate between cursing the incessant uphills and being awestruck by the beautiful scenery that is packed into the route. I rode 850 kilometers of the first edition in 2015 until I fell ill and came away with mixed feelings about the course. On the one hand, it is a complete cross-section of everything the centre of Switzerland, the Alps and mainly the Pre-Alps have to offer, featuring some stunning roads. On the other hand, the climbing at times just feels silly - as if you did it just for the sake of it rather than to find a nice trail or visit a nice pass. But beyond the insane distance/ climbing ratio and some route choices that could be reconsidered (particularly between Lucerne and the Napf) it still remains the premier event in Switzerland and an amazing way to see (and suffer) through a large cross-section of the country.</p></article>

Expect a review of the route in 2017.</p></article>

![A fantastic 500km route in our most beautiful neighboring country, mixing Tuscan backroads with trails in the Appenines, two beautiful historic cities and a rewarding final descent towards the Adriatic sea. I wrote a report on the 2016 edition here: http://bikepacker.com/coast-to-coast-in-italy ](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3491be2f-03e2-4143-a4b0-59269309251e.jpg)

Still, it looks like the most diverse of the Italian bikepacking events. I know people who will be riding it in 2017, expect a short report on it then.</p></article>

<article style=""><h1>Apulia Trail</h1><p>Probably something for rather sun-hungry bikepackers and quite a trek from Switzerland, but it might be worth it. I will try to get some first-hand information about it at some point.</p></article>

Pretty close to Switzerland and the organizers do not go lightly on the superlatives. The way the course looks, one of the more trail rather than gravel focused events.</p></article>
