# Bikepacking?

## It is like backpacking but on a bike. Or bike touring but on a mountainbike. Kind of.

Bikepacking has become a word that can encompass a lot of things. From racing 4000km on dirt roads across the US, taking your cross bike and a big backpack to conquer the Alps on a weekend to a slow tour on your fatbike across Iceland with no time limits. A narrow definition is thus quite useless. However, there seems to be a list of necessary ingredients and I would go for the following. A

* multi-day
* at least partially offroad
* as competitive as you want them to be
* adventures
* on pedal-powered wheels

is bikepacking.

As far as can be made out based on internet lore, the activity started to gain traction in the USA in the 2000s when a couple of things came together. Capable mountainbikes, lightweight luggage that made it possible to ditch cumbersome racks and a desire for adventure and touring. This got people away from race tracks and streets got and out for multi-day tours and self-organized races on singletracks and dirt roads. Today, the Great Divide Mountain Bike Race, by many considered to be the "original" bikepacking event is well-known and popular and websites such as bikepacking.net, bikepacking.com or bikepacker.com speak of an enthusiastic community with a small industry catering to the need of a growing crowd of bikepackers.

We have been a bit slower to catch on in Europe to the trend, but in the last couple of years, with a bit of marketing help from the bike industry, the word has started to surface all over the place. Especially in Italy, many bikepacking events have sprung up and contributed to spreading the bikepacking bug.

It is a great thing because bikepacking can deliver on many of the promises that are inherent to bikes. It is accessible, as gear (while obsession with it is a essential part of the online bikepacking community) is less of a necessity than one would think. An old mountainbike and a backpack or dry bag strapped to handlebars will already get you very far. It gets people out into nature in a way comparable but still different from hiking. It can reintroduce people to adventure around their homes in a way Strava, shaved legs and weight-obsessed bike racing can never do.

Finally, the great appeal of the activity is bringing people together around a love of bikes and nature. This is evident when you go out with friends to conquer a route you know nothing about, bruise your noses along the way, get stuck in mud and ride into the sunset to return another day. But often, organized bikepacking events are not too different. They seldomly are strictly policed affairs, rankings are often not published or in alphabetical order and there is a convivial feeling at the starting line. From the veteran trying to challenge his own, impossible time the year before - to the guy in jeans on his fatbike out to savour the local beer along the way.
